Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can estimate an individual's obesity level based on their reported eating habits and physical condition. The model will be trained on a publicly available dataset (link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition) containing information about individuals from various countries.

Data Description:

The dataset consists of various features related to:

Eating Habits: These features represent an individual's dietary patterns, including frequency of high-calorie food consumption, vegetable consumption, and number of meals per day.
Physical Condition: These features represent an individual's physical activity level and potential health factors, such as smoking habits and water consumption.
Obesity Level: This is the target variable, which represents the degree of an individual's weight status. It could be a categorical variable (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) or a continuous measure like Body Mass Index (BMI).
Challenges:

Imbalanced Classes: The distribution of obesity levels might be imbalanced, with more individuals falling within the normal weight range compared to underweight or obese categories.
Data Bias: Self-reported data on eating habits and physical activity can be subjective and prone to bias.
Non-linear Relationships: The relationship between eating habits, physical condition, and obesity might not be perfectly linear, requiring models that can capture complex interactions.
Objectives:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values and potential outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the distribution of features and their relationship with obesity levels.
Feature Engineering: Explore techniques to potentially create new features or address potential biases in the data.
Model Development: Train and evaluate different machine learning models for predicting obesity levels. Classification models might be suitable if obesity is a categorical variable, while regression models could be used if it's a continuous measure.
Model Selection: Choose the best performing model based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression).
Model Interpretation: Understand how the model makes predictions and identify the most influential features for predicting obesity levels.
Success Criteria:

The success of this project will be measured by the following:

A well-performing machine learning model that can accurately estimate an individual's obesity level based on the available data.
Identification of the most important features contributing to obesity according to the model.
A clear understanding of the model's limitations and the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment of obesity.
This problem statement outlines the core aspects of the project and provides a roadmap for developing a machine learning model to estimate obesity levels using dietary and physical activity data. It's important to remember that this model is for educational purposes only and should not be used for self-diagnosis.
